I know how dithering works, but I wanted to play. I read along to [Ditherpunk][dp] and in the past I tried using blue noise (with great results) -- but I was interested in "what is the worst thing that could work" (a recurring theme for me). I chose the [old "web safe" colour palette][ws] for a GIF (i.e. a 6x6x6 colour cube).

Honestly -- random noise is so much better than you'd expect! Unreasonably effective -- obviously more advanced dithering creates better results but they are substatially more work (especially when generating blue noise, which had the best results when I looked at this in the past).

[Input image is a photo I took][me] of [Colette Miller's Global Angel Wings Project][gwp] in Toronto. idk what that means for copyright, but no one is getting rich here.
